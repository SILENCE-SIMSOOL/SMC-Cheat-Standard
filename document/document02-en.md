## Messy Hypixel Rules
Hypixel has a somewhat vague yet clear rule: "Boundaries of allowed and prohibited actions are defined, but actions beyond those boundaries are not the platform's responsibility to enforce."
This means that although an action may not violate the rules, a user can still be banned, with the associated risk falling entirely on the user.
Such rules, which shift responsibility in this way, are rare in other games and impose significant challenges on players.

Most Skyblock players use various Skyblock mods.
이때 그 외의 범위에 속하는 기능들이 매우 많으며 허용 여부에 대해 물어보아도 처벌을 책임지지 않는다고만 말합니다.  
One might ask why not stick strictly to allowed mods? The issue lies in the disparity of experience; users who do not use such mods cannot enjoy the same functionalities and opportunities as those who do.
